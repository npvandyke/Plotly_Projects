# Belly Button Biodiversity 
## Project Overview 
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard is an interactive page based off a dataset documenting the bacterial cultures found in the belly buttons of 152 anonymous volunteer test subjects. By selecting a test subject ID number, a panel will be filtered to display the subject's corresponding demographic information, and three Plotly charts will populate to display data related to the bacterial cultures found in the test subject's belly button and the subject's recorded washing frequency.
